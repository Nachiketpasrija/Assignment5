# Assignment 5 – K-Means Algorithm

The mammal_Sleep dataset contains information on sleep habits for 83 mammals. Features include total sleep, length of the sleep cycle, time spent awake, brain weight, and body weight. Animals are also labeled with their name, genus, and conservation status. Here are the tasks

#### Loaded the dataset mammal_Sleep.csv into a data frame and Created a new data frame mammalSleep with sleep_total and sleep_rem. Cleaned the dataset by omitting NAs values because with those values K-Means Clustering is giving ""NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call" error.

#### Fit a k-means clustering model with 4 clusters to the data subset mammalSleep.

#### Find the centroids of the clusters in the model on the chart (If you can’t figure how to it using fviz_cluster function, you can use plot() or geom_point().
